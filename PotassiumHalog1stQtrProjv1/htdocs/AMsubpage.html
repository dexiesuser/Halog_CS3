  <h1>AM's Beneath the Boardwalk to The Car: A Deep Dive</h1>
  <p>Arctic Monkeys have changed in the twenty years since they were founded in Sheffield. The group has evolved from indie upstarts to fashionable retro-rockers with a taste for old pianos and complex ideas.

The clattering guitars of barnstorming songs like I Bet You Look Good On The Dance Floor and 505 have been firmly replaced by luscious strings, soft jazz, and soul in a slow process.

The Car, the group's seventh album, completes their most recent makeover and perfects the model set by Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, their concept album from 2018 that was based on an opulent moon resort.</p>
