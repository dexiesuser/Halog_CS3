		<p> <h3> Shown above is the title and a glimpse of my favorite movie: Submarine (2010).
		It is a coming-of-age indie film centered around a boy named Oliver Tate with big
		ambitions regarding his life, and the people around him. I have a profound appreciation
		for this movie, because it feels so raw and real to me, it makes me feel understood
		about my own struggles growing to become a teenager. </h3> </p>
