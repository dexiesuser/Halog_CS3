  <h1>Nevermind by Nirvana</h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>Our perception of music forever changed the moment Nirvana released Nevermind back in 1992.</li>
    <li>Bringing a new sludgier, angsty sound to the rock arena, Nirvana was the rose between the thorn bushes. 
      Despite being drastically different from the top releases at the time, the band pushed their iconic grunge sound to the mainstream.</li>
    <li>Modern day music still continues to let Nirvana live on their legacy, as the influence never dies. 
      Even if the band was short-lived due to lead singer Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994, grunge lives on.</li>
    <li>Since I was a child, songs like "All Apologies," and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" blasted on the local radio, making young me an instant fan. 
      Their songs and the band's influence still shape who I am today. Aside from hard-hitting, headbang-worthy tracks on their albums; all members inspire me 
    to embrace my individuality, and live my life to the fullest. </li>
