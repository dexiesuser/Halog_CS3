  <h1>AM by Arctic Monkeys</h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>Released in 2013, the AM album by the Arctic Monkeys brought rock-and-roll to the mainstream once again.</li>
    <li>With catchy guitar riffs and a hypnotizing beat with every album track, AM succeeded in engaging listeners to appreciate the rock genre.</li>
    <li>Top hits like "Do I Wanna Know" and "Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?" gained acclaim and praise from the general crowd, topping charts on streaming sites like Spotify.</li>
    <li>In my own experience, this was one of the first rock albums that made me fall deep into the rabbit hole of the rock genre, earning a precious place in my heart.</li>
