  <h1>OK Computer by Radiohead</h1>
  <hr>
  <ul>
    <li>In 1997, the third studio album of Radiohead called "OK Computer" hit the record shops. 
      Little did the anticipating fans knew what depth of emotional discovery and raw melancholy the album had waiting for them.</li>
    <li>Unlike their former hit song "Creep" in the album "Pablo Honey," OK Computer gave heart-wrenching insight on helplessness, alienation, and the world falling apart. 
      A new range of emotional impact swarmed the listeners, as it took rock music to another world of realism and "swoony rhythm" all at once. </li>
    <li>The album received major critical acclaim, labeled as a "futuristic breakthrough," and "one of the best albums in 20 years."</li>
    <li>Words cannot describe on how much I love this album. It helped comfort me in tough times, and made me realize the flaws and gifts of being human. "Exit Music (For A Film)"
      is still my top #1 cry song at my weakest moments. </li>
  </ul>
